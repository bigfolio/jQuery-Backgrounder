jQuery Backgrounder Plugin
===

This is the jQuery Backgrounder plugin. This plugin allows you to fill the background of a page with an image–all while maintaining the aspect ratio and gracefully handling window resizing.

How to use it
---

* Include jQuery and the plugin file in your page
* Add a div to your page which includes an image. The div can be set to display:none; if you'd like. I prefer fairly large images but any size will do.
* Call the backgrounder() function on your div—preferably when the page loads.
* No CSS file is required
* Use the demo.html page for guidance.
